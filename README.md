## Setup

2. Add your packages to the [pkgs](./pkgs) directory and to
   [default.nix](./default.nix)
   * Remember to mark the broken packages as `broken = true;` in the `meta`
     attribute, or build (and consequently caching) will fail!
3. Github actions: Change your NUR repo name and optionally add a cachix name in [.github/workflows/build.yml](./.github/workflows/build.yml) and change the cron timer
     to a random value as described in the file
6. [Add yourself to NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR#how-to-add-your-own-repository)
